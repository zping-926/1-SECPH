# ⚡ SECR1013: Digital Logic


### 📖 Course Reflection

This course provides a deep dive into the internal mechanics of digital systems. By transitioning from theoretical **Number Systems** to practical circuit design using **Deeds software**, the course demonstrates how simple logic gates can be combined to form complex processors. 

The hands-on experience in the digital lab—especially designing **Synchronous Counters** and managing intricate breadboard wiring—has been both challenging and rewarding. As a Data Engineering student, understanding this hardware-software interface is essential for appreciating how data is physically processed and stored at the most fundamental level.
