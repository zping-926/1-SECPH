# ⌨️ SECJ1013: Programming Technique I

### 📖 Course Reflection
This course has provided me with a solid foundation in problem-solving through a structured programming approach. By mastering the C++ language, I have learned how to transform complex logic into functional programs, moving from solving simple tasks to tackling more moderate computational challenges.

From mastering **control structures** to the more advanced **arrays** and **pointers**, the journey has taught me how to break down complex problems into logical, executable steps. The most rewarding part was learning **File Operations** and **Pointers**, which are crucial for efficient memory management and data handling. These skills are the building blocks for my journey in **Data Engineering**, providing me with the precision and logic needed to develop robust software solutions.
