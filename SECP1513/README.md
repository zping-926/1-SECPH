## 📂 Course Reflection

This course, SECP1513: Technology and Information System, has been an eye-opening introduction to the vast world of Information Technology. Throughout the semester, I have explored various aspects of technology, from understanding SAP operational streams and data analytics in global companies like PPG, to learning about innovation in commerce with Serunai Commerce.

These experiences have not only strengthened my technical knowledge but also inspired me to think critically about how technology drives meaningful business transformation and sustainability. It has been a rewarding journey that has prepared me for my future as a Data Engineering student.
