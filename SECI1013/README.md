# 🔢 SECI1013: Discrete Structure


### 📖 Course Reflection
Discrete Structure provides a comprehensive introduction to the principles and applications of discrete mathematics in computer science. The curriculum spans essential topics including set theory, proof techniques, relations, functions, and recurrence relations, as well as counting methods, graph theory, trees, and finite automata.

The course empowers me to solve complex computational problems and model electronic devices through finite state machines. By bridging the gap between mathematical theory and real-world applications, it serves as a critical foundation for any Data Engineering student, fostering the analytical and logical skills necessary to navigate the ever-evolving field of technology.**Set Theory** and **Proof Techniques** to understanding **Graph Theory** and **Trees**, each topic has enhanced my ability to solve complex problems systematically. These concepts are particularly vital for my studies in **Data Engineering**, especially when dealing with data relations and recurrence models.
